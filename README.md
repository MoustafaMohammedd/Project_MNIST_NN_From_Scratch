# MNIST Neural Network Projects  

This repository contains implementations of neural networks for classifying MNIST handwritten digits using different approaches.  

## Project Overview  

The following implementations are provided:  

1. **Project_MNIST_NN_Pytorch.ipynb**  
   - A neural network implemented using PyTorch for classifying MNIST digits.  
   - Utilizes PyTorch's deep learning capabilities to train and evaluate the model efficiently.  

2. **Project_MNIST_NN_From_Scratch.ipynb**  
   - A neural network built from scratch without using deep learning frameworks like PyTorch or TensorFlow.  
   - Implements forward and backward propagation manually.  

3. **Project_MNIST_NN_From_Scratch_oop.ipynb**  
   - An object-oriented version of the neural network built from scratch.  
   - Uses Python's OOP principles to structure the neural network efficiently.  

## Dataset  
The MNIST dataset consists of 4,000 training images and 1,000 test images of handwritten digits (0-9). It is commonly used for benchmarking deep learning models.
